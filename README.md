# Project 3: Regular Expressions

* Author: Justin Raver, Nick Stolarow
* Class: CS361 Section 1
* Semester: Spring 2021

## Overview

This Java applications builds an NFA from a REGEX passed by the user. It
then converts the NFA to an equivalent DFA and tests strings outputting "yes"
if the string is accepted and "no" if the string is rejected by the DFA.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac Marshmallow.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java Marshmallow
```

You will be prompted for integer values representing distance to the fire,
fire intensity, marshmallow burn resistance, and marshmallow sugar density.
