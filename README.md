# Project 3: Regular Expressions

* Author: Justin Raver, Nick Stolarow
* Class: CS361 Section 1
* Semester: Spring 2021

## Overview

This Java applications builds an NFA from a REGEX passed by the user. It
then converts the NFA to an equivalent DFA and tests strings outputting "yes"
if the string is accepted and "no" if the string is rejected by the DFA.

## Compiling and Using

```
 
 Build: javac re/REDriver.java
 
 Run: java re.REDriver ./tests/<test name>
 
```
